Create a leap year verifications class called LeapYear.

1. A leap year is:
   1. - divisible by 4
   2. - not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.

2. The leap year was introduced in the Julian calendar in 46 BC.
  However, around 10 BC, it was found that the priests in charge
  of computing the calendar had been adding leap years every three
  years instead of the four decreed by Caesar (Vardi 1991, p. 239).
  As a result of this error, no more leap years were added until 8 AD.

    * 4AD -> no leap year
    * 0AD -> no leap year
    * 50BC -> no leap year
    * 8 AD -> leap year
    * 30 BC -> leap year
    * 45BC -> leap year
